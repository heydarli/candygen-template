Traveling enriches our lives and helps us to learn more about various cultures, people and their traditions. Traveling helps us to get away from our daily routines and notice the beauty of everyday life. However, sometimes we fall into traps of tourist attractions and only get classic experience of a place we visit. I have traveled quite a bit across Europe, USA  and Australia, and developed a good understanding of how to feel at home while traveling. There are a few tips I would like to share, that will help you truly experience the city or region you are traveling in.</p>\n    \n</div>\n\n<div class=\"card__img\"><img alt=\"travel plan\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ULseM_t5-4LlRCMPi07bV1h02hdrhcKj5BbKvu6uLnGokAh0yVb8EeH1V6Z7BcnPVKALmO1teWFHbST2wnVsnpI=s1000\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"card__body\">\n    <p class=\"lead\">Find the places where locals spend their time</p>\n\n    <p>Well this is not any easy one but definitely worths the time and energy. Before going on a trip try to conduct a short research about the place you are going. Try to find out where locals usually have their lunch or dinner, where is the best coffee or what is the best bakery in town. However be careful in your research, not everything that has 5 stars on TripAdvisor is actually great and not necessarily approved by the locals. I always try my best to find lists that were made by locals or endorsed by people who live in the area. Do not plainly follow star ratings on Google, check the place carefully, see the menu and photos of food or events first. Moreover if you did not have time for research, do not despair. Sometimes it is a good idea to just wander around the streets and find the most crowded places, people would never lign up unless it worth it, or it is McDonalds. Talk to people in the line, ask what is their favourite meal in this place, or which drink should you try. It is also important to mention that location of some places make a huge difference, some cafes & restaurants might be crowded purely because they are situated in the city centre, but if you take a left or right turn to a narrow street, that does not look very flashy or interesting you might find the best lunch spot in town. Do not be afraid to explore.</p>\n    \n</div>\n\n<div class=\"card__img\"><img alt=\"local chat\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nGQdYFT5J0zPbO68yegEB5oYMsnHrtpcVEK7-NL9WEYGPv0WeWX-muKZSJXNGERN2fIPX3yj7nkKc7Pj1b1rTg=s1000\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"card__body\">\n    <p class=\"lead\">Talk to people</p>\n\n    <p>How great is it to have friends, who are locals and can show you around. But unfortunately it is not always the case. What to do, if you do not know anyone in the city? Well there are a few options. You can find local guides, who can provide you with tours and show you all the hidden gems. That is a great opportunity to discover the city and get answers to all of your questions.  However you should also be ready to talk to strangers. I know, I know it is a bit intimidating at times. But do not be afraid to ask, people will usually be willing to help you out with directions and recommendations.</p>\n    \n    \n</div>\n\n<div class=\"card__img\"><img alt=\"hotel room\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/aWf1MS3E96UGDyqq94bjomxW3SDlm7iCyKfAlo_VxKxPG4xR5_Y7Tnb3JEPELm9h3LGPpOCREEpmiYejl0ar1g=s1000\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"card__body\">\n    <p class=\"lead\">Love hotels? We love them too </p>\n    \n    <p>Hotels are amazing, and who doesn’t like room service. But how often does a hotel feel like home? Sometimes it does, especially with current hotels focusing on design and common areas usability. It is comfortable and nice but it may not give you an idea of how people live in the place where you are travelling. Want a truly local experience, then try meeting with locals. You will learn so much more about the lifestyle and all the small things people do differently by spending time with them. However as it is not always an option, try to find hotels with a convenient location, that will allow you to either make an advantage of public transport or walk around more. Moreover there are endless opportunities of connecting with local guides and GetGuided is one way to to that. You can book your time with a guide, who was either born or spent a long time in the city where you are. It is great to have a local uide by your side, who knows all about the hidden gems, fun facts and must sees in the city.</p>\n</div>\n"},"type":"website"},{"uvFileId":"225736978","path":"/website/content/tc.yml","data":{"pageId":"tc","title":"Terms & Conditions","items":[{"type":"heading","items":[{"type":"h2","content":"Terms and conditions"},{"type":"small","content":"by GETGUIDED Team"}],"style":"margin: 20px 0;"},{"type":"text-content","content":["<strong>User Terms and Conditions</strong>","getguided.net is a product of GETGUIDED LTD.

The passion for travel, and the dream to see new and foreign places, however, never abandoned her. After her sons left home – she was already 45 – she finally had the free time and independence to fulfil her wish. Over the years she undertook two trips around the globe, visiting all the continents and writing fascinating accounts of her trips.

She became a professor of archeology, as well as a professional mountaineer, scaling numerous peaks throughout Europe and America.

And I could probably count on two hands the number of those which I’ve seen more than the inside of a conference centre, office or hotel. Occasionally, I’d wake up in a perfectly pleasant (nondescript) hotel room and have to check my calendar-‘it’s Tuesday, must be Frankfurt...’\n    \n      The best business trip I ever took was the only one on which I took someone with me, and went off the beaten (corporate) path.\n      It was Istanbul, and I took my sister. It was a gruelling but extremely productive week spent in lovely albeit windowless\n      meeting spaces. My amazing events director Melinda Bernstein found us a fabulous local guide, and we explored the city. Not\n      just the usual tourist haunts, but fantastical hidden spots that noone but a local would know.\n      \n      After most business trips -- the prepping, presenting, schmoozing, temperature-extreme conference rooms, long flights,\n      unhealthy food -- I’m generally exhausted mentally if not physically. Post-trip recovery and getting back into the groove at\n      work can be a painful, caffeine-fuelled process. But not after Istanbul. I came back refreshed and raring to go, inspired, and\n      brim-full of new ideas.\n      \n      The vaguely repellent but apt industry term 'bleisure', blending business and leisure trips, is not just\n      an opportunity for travel suppliers. If a business traveller's experience can enhance their productivity, not to mention their\n      well-being and company loyalty, the return on investment for their employer is dramatically amplified. The reason your company\n      spends what to many (e.g. your finance department) seems an inordinate sum on business travel is because it’s the best way to\n      grow pretty much any business. Whether it’s winning new business, retaining existing business, or optimising the company itsel,\n      nothing beats being there in person, particularly when you’re working across cultures, and so much can be lost in translation\n      without face to face communication to build and sustain relationships.Scott Gillespie has been writing persuasively about the\n      impact of business traveller ‘friction’ for years. \n      \n      As Scott writes, “Traveller friction - the wear and tear on frequent travellers - comes in the form of lower traveller\n      productivity. Think flying coach from Chicago to Singapore...” \n      \n      While it took some time for the industry to recognise traveller friction’s tangible impact on bottom line results, it’s clear\n      that strategic travel managers are now incorporating traveller productivity into their programmes.  \n      \n      I was privileged to serveon a panel at last year’s Business Travel Show on ‘New savings from a mature programme’. I was\n      thrilled that our illustrious moderator, Amon Cohen, not only allowed me to veer the conversation into traveller productivity,\n      but that my highly accomplished fellow panellists, Kerrie Henshaw-Cox and Carol Randall, both with deep travel management\n      expertise, provided ample evidence that this is the next frontier in delivering return on travel investment. And the ROI\n      opportunity isn’t limited to a particular demographic in your traveller base. Millennials may be the ones known for valuing\n      experiences over expenditures, but more senior travellers benefit equally, and arguably could deliver more, for ‘bleisure’ and\n      related perks. Traveller productivity initiatives can drive business growth and employee retention. For some great questions to\n      kickstart a traveller productivity initiative, check out the inspiring Caroline Strachan’s article ‘Travel’s place in the\n      workplace’. Memories of Istanbul (and serendipitously, Baku)\n      drove my latest adventure.\n      \n      I’ve joined a travel start-up delivering exactly what I got most out of that trip-unique guided experiences to get out of the\n      conference room and live a little local. GetGuided is in the first wave of companies pivoting the industry’s perspective on the\n      total value business travel can and should deliver. We’re working with suppliers and corporate travel managers committed to\n      delivering traveller productivity for clients and stakeholders.\n      \n      Whether it’s local experiences, or other traveller-valued perks (check out Upside for a non-TMC option to boost your\n      travellers’ happy factor), investing in the traveller experience delivers increased traveller productivity, which leads to\n      business growth, employee retention, and greater returns on travel investments. Making travel managers local heroes. Instead of\n      the ones telling staff to take economy from Chicago to Singapore.</p>\n    \n</div>\n"},"type":"website"},{"uvFileId":"1029061379","path":"/website/blog/2018-01-20-004.yml","data":{"title":"Moscow, to get or not to get guided?","subtitle":"How a storyteller can help you fall in love with the city","coverUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ad9CFMQNu2g4pfJYdWzneBmYD9v_AJApWu6vJZga3Q8WTsCr1Er43hlzBWMZgy7510ervSlUOyF1przyr_gQRbA=s1000","author":{"name":"GETGUIDED Team, Cavid","description":"Personal experience with Moscow","photo":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RL5Fk-xSJX8BzgnNxLnBKc5mXSNohH7NyaQunz64u_IDLlrDt4Qrst0ncL06KpY_wtrsRwoKExfAlqspD1--=s1000","social":{"instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/getguidednet","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/getguidednet","twitter":"https://twitter.com/getguidednet"}},"preview":"<p>If you asked me four years ago \"Would you book a guide to explore a city?\", my answer would have been a definite no.</p>\n","content":"\n\n<div class=\"card__body\">\n    <p class=\"lead\">What are we missing?</p>\n\n    <p>If you asked me four years ago \"Would you book a guide to explore a city?\", my answer would have been a definite no.

When people asked me after about Moscow, I’m embarrassed to say now, would tell them it was not worth the trip.My second trip was more of a ‘bleisure’ trip; I was attending TravelTech Conference Russia organised by Valentin Dombrovsky. After the event I planned to explore the city. I was speaking with our suppliers who had recently joined our platform, and they happily invited me on a local tour. I took three tours with 3 amazing guides - Moscow City Tour; Metro Tour, and Kremlin Tour, and in those six (two hours each) or so hours, I learned more than I could have ever imagined, and enjoyed every minute despite harsh weather.

Discovering new cultures and introducing people to mine is my hobby. Here are my three picks from my culture I wanted to share with you.</p>\n    \n</div>\n\n<div class=\"card__img\"><img alt=\"Dolma\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ESuKnX1ZsD_Nw6iYjfJKh2q9-6D9Kpcuh4LLh_xjl8stlDjoJxUHTAOBJGznFHbVyG2ypRJ66u1vGL-agULjqg=s1000\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"card__body\">\n    <p class=\"lead\">Try local cuisine, Dolma</p>\n\n    <p>Dolma is one of the most popular dishes in Azerbaijani cuisine, and one of the most iconic ones. There are two types of dolma, the \"Classic\" ( Yarpaq Dolmasi) which is grape leaves stuffed with meat and rice or “Three Sisters” Dolma ( Badimcan Dolmasi)- stuffed eggplants, tomatoes and bell peppers. Both kinds of dolma are delicious and will introduce you to the local taste of Baku. Ask for a yogurt & garlic sauce to enrich this dish (sarimsag qatiq).</p>\n    \n</div>\n\n<div class=\"card__img\"><img alt=\"old town\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5r4f8Bpn2UsGBd3PbiGoVXfAEqzEttd6jEuphMPHEGLk1V1h00pYV7tjo8GIUNPZ7OpKn_X8BKRAcn4_-44uBA=s1000\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"card__body\">\n    <p class=\"lead\">Visit Old Town and go up the Maiden Tower</p>\n\n    <p>Probably one of the top tourist attractions, as well as favourite place for locals to hang out and rediscover their city. Full of history ( Icerisheher) dates back to the 12th century. You can take a walking tour around Old City, or just wander around on your own. It’s quite easy  to get lost in there, but don’t worry people do live in the old town and will help you out if you find yourself lost. The Maiden Tower, is a symbol of Baku. There are many legends and tales about this tower, and the truth still remains a mystery. Currently this tower is a historical museum, and if you go in and climb to the top, you will get a pretty amazing view of the city.</p>\n  \n    \n</div>\n\n<div class=\"card__img\"><img alt=\"boulevard\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nkNE1WGnUsk8Xi_hzW8WhXlWNbI0h9gAF6ZOGoVsYZ9gsUcNBHLYxDKAmeF2f5XTqPe82kqE5POf3532C3Cn=s1000\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"card__body\">\n    <p class=\"lead\">Stroll down the boulevard</p>\n    \n    <p>Baku gets insanely hot in summers and to survive the heat people head to the beach. But in case you are in the city a nice place to spend your evening is Baku Boulevard. Stroll down the boulevard after the sunset and enjoy the summer breeze. Get some tea in one of the cafes with some local home-made jam ( murebbe)..</p>\n</div>\n"},"type":"website"},{"uvFileId":"1600829216","path":"/website/blog/2017-10-24-002.yml","data":{"title":"Christmas in Edinburgh","subtitle":"Enjoy Christmas in Edinburgh, with touch of magic","coverUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/znhUT5fhYB4F16WbI5hhdDkCtS8-_ql8g3VjNKHwabXKqbhF4Gvbdbk0BDrxX35GaoP5DzUGFXobQW15PQ-qtg=s1000","author":{"name":"GETGUIDED Team, Cavid","description":"People who love travel and willing to help others do the same","photo":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1NwPkOwnoI4oy-Nu0ccCcLnJMzqkAj8Q3PpQ-TudrSju5ekGWgOcXwnNEZSXsUGMzwr3Ce1VUUpT-gISKHlJ=s1000","social":{"instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/getguidednet","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/getguidednet","twitter":"https://twitter.com/getguidednet"}},"preview":"<p>Christmas in Edinburgh is Magical enough.

Additionally, there is an amazing show of Lights and Music everyday on George Street. This stunning show will have your faces smiling from late November until New Year, which is celebrated on Princes Street Hogmanay Party with music, people and freworks.</p>\n    \n</div>\n\n<div class=\"card__img\"><img alt=\"JKRowling\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RA_EhwJNLbp96mk4EknhE5pXZgwlSnp_M0TWrp6bzJXIi5DEEeKD0aVROSl1gnscvHQYdRXAXzGCDt37Bwv-XTI=s1000\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"card__body\">\n    <p class=\"lead\">Birth of Harry Potter</p>\n\n    <p>As mentioned above, to add a little more magic, you need to visit sites where Harry Potter was inspired. There are two cafes, where J.K.Rowling has spent her time writing the book, Spoon and Elephant House.  Although Spoon Cafe is very humble and quiet about it with only one small sign on the wall, Elephant House is definitely saying it out loud and it is one of the most visited by tourists cafe.\n    \n      Located just behind the Elephant House cafe, Greyfriars Kirkyard is a place of an\n      inspiration for character names of Harry Potter. You can spend your time trying to find\n      the names.\n      \n      The next stop would be colourful Victoria street, where almost every shop is\n      a different colour, and said to be an inspiration for Diagon Alley of Harry Potter. Not\n      far from Victoria Street, on Royal Mile you can find hand prints of the author. \n      \n      For even more recent realtion to Harry Potter, you can check Balmoral hotel, where the \n      latest book was written by J.K.Rowling. </p>\n  \n    \n</div>\n"},"type":"website"},{"uvFileId":"1653641903","path":"/website/content/websiteterms.yml","data":{"pageId":"wterms","title":"Website Terms","items":[{"type":"heading","items":[{"type":"h2","content":"Website Terms"},{"type":"small","content":"by GETGUIDED Team"}],"style":"margin: 20px 0;"},{"type":"text-content","content":["<strong>PLEASE READ THESE WEBSITE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SITE</strong>","<strong>What's in these terms?</strong>","These terms tell you the rules for using our website https://getguided.co.net/ (our site).","<strong>Who we are and how to contact us</strong>","https://getguided.co.net/ is a site operated by GetGuided Limited (“We” or “GetGuided”).
